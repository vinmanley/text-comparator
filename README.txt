Threaded Cosine Distance Calculator

Main Features:

+  Menu-driven UI to guide user.
Comprehensive menu guides user through every step of the program. User input is validated and
alternative paths and returns are available for the user. I wanted to provide the user with 
enough information and clear options so user choices are clear.

+  User can choose between file or URL input for comparison.
Allows the user to choose local txt files or URL sources for text comparison. I wanted to give
the user the flexibility to choose between different text sources.

+  User can access website for more information about calculating cosine distance.
This options opens a website in the users native browser giving details about calculating
cosine distance to judge text similarity. I included this option so that the user can make 
clear choices about texts to compare and shingle size to use.

+  User can set shingle size from 3 preset options
I have allowed the user to choose between single word, 3-word and 5-word to allow them to modify
how their texts are compared and also to help them understand how the program completes the task.

+  Program uses threaded operations to convert text to ArrayLists and Map Objects.
The program efficiently completes its tasks using threads for the text conversion steps. I have
attempted to make this program as efficient as possible to make it more user friendly and useful.

+  Program removes punctuation from the texts and converts to lower case to allow for more efficient
matching.
